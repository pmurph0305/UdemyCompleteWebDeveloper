- Relational database.

Similar to SQLite which I used in cs50,
has similar commands, but no longer using cs50's api for database commands.

Course ran through create/drop table, insert/update/delete rows, and join tables.

Used pgadmin4 for GUI, explored it to see how it all works through that GUI.
Seems similar, but with more functionality than phpliteadmin which was used in cs50.

Used vscode terminal to execute postgresql commands.

commands:
must login with: psql -U postgres

\timing shows timing of query results.


\c database_name connects to that database.
\q quit postgres


\d for list of TABLES in a database.
\d table_name for description of table.
\d+ for more thorough description with additional info.
\d+ table_name similar to above but for specific table.

\l for list of all DATABASES
\l+ above with extra info

\dn lists all schemas.
\dn+ above with extra info.'

\df list all functions
\df+ above with extra info.
